Overview of the project

Project: Python programming on Student Grade Tracker in the examination or any tests-based performance.

Objective

The project is to create a program that allows users to manage and track student grades. The class students' attributes store the value of the student 
and grades are a Dictionary that holds grades for different subjects, where each subject has a list of grades. This program is designed to be interactive and informative, 
facilitating the management and analysis of student performance based on their grades.

Key Activities
•	Student: Creating a Student Object An instance of the ‘student’ class is created to represent a specific student. The object holds the student’s name and a dictionary 
‘grades’ to store grades for different subjects.
•	Inputting Grades: the program prompts the user to input grades for various subjects or assignments.
•	Calculating Average Grade: The program calculates the average grade for all subjects combined. This is achieved by summing up all grades across subjects and dividing by 
the total number of grades.
•	Calculating GPA: Based on the average grade computed, the program determines the GPA using a predefined grading scale. GPA is typically mapped to specific ranges of 
average grades.
•	Determining Overall Grade: The overall grade (e.g., A, B, C) is derived based on the average grade. This provides a quick summary of the student's performance across all 
subjects.
•	Displaying Grades and Summary: Throughout the process, the program interacts with the user via console input and output. It prompts for input, validates data, and provides 
meaningful output to summarize the student's academic performance.


Technologies used

•	Python: Python is used in the core Python programming language to develop the entire application. It provides a clear syntax, extensive standard library, and ease of 
readability, making it suitable for task data manipulation and calculation, such as managing student grades.
•	Object-Oriented Programming: The task leverages OOP principles through the creativity of a ‘Student’ class. This class encapsulates data (student name and grades) and 
behaviour (calculating average grade, GPA, and overall grade) related to managing and analyzing student grades.
•	Standard Input and Output: Python's standard input (‘input()’) and output (‘print()’) functions are used for interactive communication with the user. Input functions are 
utilised to gather student names, subject names, and grades from the user. Output functions were employed to display entered grades and summary information such as average 
grade, GPA, and overall grade.
•	Data Structures: Python's built-in data structures, such as dictionaries (‘grades’ dictionary in the ‘Student’ class), organize and store data efficiently. 
Lists are used to store grades for each subject within the grades dictionary.
•	Mathematical Computations: Basic mathematical operations (sum, division) are performed to calculate the average grade and determine GPA based on the average grade. 
Conditional statements (‘if’-‘elif’-‘else’) are used to average grades to GPA ranges and overall letter grades.
•	Control Flow: Control flow constructs (loops and conditional statements) are employed to manage the flow of the program. Loops facilitate iterative input of grades for 
multiple subjects, and conditional statements validate user input and determine GPA and overall grades based on average grades.
